            <h6 class="alttitle">
		 </br> </br>   Through art, I am able to share my views, feelings, and opinions on certain topics. I want to share not only my talent, but a message through the use of visual symbols. While my portfolio contains object and architectural observations, overall, it focuses on two themes: memories and obsessions. My memories are a reflection of my family and myself and the emotions I felt. To me, these memories brought a range of emotions from happiness to disappointment. But also, it shows my personal journey to who I have become.
</br> </br></br> 
My other focus has been on obsessions and addictions. While all addictions are not bad, the addictions I focus on are prevalent in teenagers, such as social media, beauty, phones, stress, etc. As a teenager myself, I also struggle with some of these addictions and I hope others can learn about some of the dangers of these addictions. With art, I am able to show people the whirlpool effect of these addictions, sucking us into the darkness. By using different types of media, like glass and water bottles, I can emphasize the meaning of the painting. In addition to using different media, I created a series of pieces that told a story, portraying societal pressures.

With this portfolio, I am able to show my personal journey as well as the dangers of certain obsessions.

                    <li class="has-animation"><img src="art stuff color.jpg" alt="mapbox"/></a><p>Before starting a piece of work, I prepare my paints, palette, brushes, and water. Preparing these materials has become a ritual for me. By drawing the observation of my preparations, I want to display all the material I use as well as the amount of thought put into choosing each. Though it may be messy, preparing the materials before the piece allows me to carefully pick and choose. While this piece displays my setup and preparation, other artists may use different materials and tools to create their masterpieces.</p></li>
                    <li class="has-animation"><img src="Backpack.jpg" alt="mapbox"/></a><p>My backpack is always heavy as if I am carrying tons of rocks. When I come home, I always empty my backpack. I would pull out binders, folders, writing implements, pencil case, etc. The list is endless and it’s as if my backpack is like Mary Poppins’ bag. I drew the many possessions in my school backpack to depict the items that a student carries. At school, students receive piles of assignments and papers that are all stuffed into their backpack, making their backpack even heavier and full of supplies. With this piece, I wanted to show all the materials students carry in their backpack once they come home.</p></li>

                    <li class="has-animation"><img src="One Bright Thought.jpg" alt="mapbox"/></a><p>Whenever I am feeling down, I think of a bright memory or thought that will help me feel better. Bright thoughts allow people to feel a burst of happiness. I wanted to create a piece that reflects my happiness and can brighten another person’s day. By using colorful Copic markers and different shapes, I am able to create a unique, colorful piece. The colorful tones of the piece alone can make someone else feel warmth. As a result, I want others to know that even during tough times, it is important to think back to a happier moment.</p></li>
                    <li class="has-animation"><img src="Claire with Leafgrayscale.jpg" alt="mapbox"/></a><p>Every morning when I wake up, I end up with messy hair due to my improper sleeping position. My sleeping reflects my personality. I am seen as calm and nice, but sometimes, I am energetic and crazy. The leaves around my face represent the serenity of my personality and how relaxed I feel. My hair is tangly and scattered around my face, displaying how sometimes I am “messy” and can be chaotic at times. Like me, many people hide their inner craziness and only show what is socially acceptable: well behaved, elegant, and calm.</p></li>

Recycling is important to me because the paper, plastic, and aluminum can all be reused to make another item. As a result, this animation shows the story of a red plastic cup after being thrown into the trash. The cup’s journey begins in a home’s cupboard, but ends up traveling to unexpected places and end all the way at a beach filled with other trash. This video emphasizes the importance of recycling and I hope that others can recognize that recycling is an important issue that needs to be addressed. It encourages others to be environmentally friendly and properly throw away recyclables. With this video, I hope everyone can put a foot forward to transform the Earth into a eco-friendly place and home.
